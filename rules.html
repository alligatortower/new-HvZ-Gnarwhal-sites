          <h1>The Rules</h1>
          <p class="rules-intro">These are the official &rdquo;Goucher-Style&rdquo; Humans vs. Zombies rules as invented by Brad Sappington and Chris Weed in 2005, with a few changes since to make the game more balanced and safe.</p>
          <p class='rules-intro'>We encourage you to adapt the rules to fit your game &dash; account for what will keep your players safe and your game exciting. You can see dozens of alternate rule sets on the <a href="http://wiki.humansvszombies.org/" target="_blank">wiki</a> or talk to players about <a href="http://forums.humansvszombies.org/" target="_blank">what works best in their games</a>.</p>
          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>Humans vs. Zombies is a game of tag. All players begin as humans, and one is randomly chosen to be the &ldquo;Original Zombie.&rdquo; The Original Zombie tags human players and turns them into zombies. Zombies must tag and eat a human every 48 hours or they starve to death and are out of the game.</p>
          <h2>Objective</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>The Zombies win when all human players have been tagged and turned into zombies.</li>
            <li>The Humans win by surviving long enough for all of the zombies to starve.</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Equipment</h2>
          <p>This gear is required for all players:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Bandana</li>
            <li>Foam Dart Blaster, Marshmallow Launcher, and/or socks</li>
            <li>One 3x5 index card</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Safety Rules</h2>
          <p>Rules created for the safety of all players are strictly enforced. Violation of safety rules will result in a ban from the game.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>No realistic looking weaponry. Blasters must be brightly colored and have blaze-orange tips.</li>
            <li>Blasters may not be visible inside of academic buildings or jobs on campus.</li>
            <li>Players may not use cars or play where there is traffic.</li>
            <li>*Socks, Darts, or Marshmallows must not hurt on impact.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><small>*Foam dart blasters and marshmallow launchers are children&rsquo;s toys &ndash; it should be obvious that your blaster won&rsquo;t hurt anyone. If you modify your blaster or are somehow not sure if it is safe, speak with a moderator and ask them to check your blaster.</small></p>
          <h2>Safe Zones</h2>
          <p>Some areas on campus are &ldquo;no play zones,&rdquo; where the game is permanently suspended. blasters must be concealed and no players may be stunned or tagged. These areas include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Academic buildings</li>
            <li>Libraries</li>
            <li>Indoor athletic facilities</li>
            <li>Health Centers</li>
            <li>Restrooms</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Other areas on campus are merely &ldquosafe zones&rdquo, where gameplay continues but humans can&rsquot be tagged (unless a zombie has both of their feet outside the safe zone). These areas include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Dorm Rooms</li>
            <li>Dining Halls</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Human Rules</h2>
          <p><strong>Staying On Campus:</strong> Humans must sleep on campus. If you need to leave campus for longer than 24 hours, contact the game moderators and remove yourself from the game.</p>
          <p><strong>I.D. Number:</strong> Humans must keep an index card with their unique identification number on them at all times.</p>
          <p><strong>Stunning a Zombie:</strong> Humans may stun a Zombie for 15 minutes by blasting them with a blaster or throwing a sock at them.</p>
          <p><strong>When Tagged By a Zombie:</strong> When tagged by a Zombie, a Human is required to distribute their ID card. One hour after being tagged, tie your bandanna around your head &ndash; you are now a member of the Zombie team! Go tag some Humans.</p>
          <p><strong>Wearing a Bandanna:</strong> Humans must wear a headband around an arm or leg to identify them as players of the game. (This headband will come in handy when you become a zombie!)</p> 
          <h2>Zombie Rules</h2>
          <p><strong>Feeding:</strong> Zombies must feed every 48 hours. A zombie feeds by reporting their tag on the website.</p>
          <p><strong>Wearing A Headband:</strong> Zombies must wear a bandanna around their heads at all times. The Original Zombie does not need to wear a headband.</p>
          <p><strong>Tagging</strong>: A tag is a firm touch to any part of a Human. After tagging a Human the Zombie must collect their ID card and report the tag.</p>
          <p><strong>Getting Shot:</strong> When hit with a dart, a marshmallow, or a sock, a Zombie is stunned for 15 minutes. A stunned zombie may not interact with the game in any way. This includes shielding other zombies from bullets or continuing to run toward a human. If shot while stunned, the zombie&rsquo;s stun timer is reset back to 15 minutes.</p> 
          <h2>Other Rules</h2>
          <p><strong>Blasting Non-Players:</strong> Blasting non-players is a bannable offense.</p>
          <p><strong>Non-Player Interference:</strong> People who are not registered participants may not directly interact with the game. This includes bringing food to humans or spying for either team.</p>
          <p><strong>Safe Zones:</strong> A zombie must have both feet outside of a safe zone to tag a human. Humans can stun zombies from inside of a safe-zone.</p>
          <p><strong>No Shields:</strong> Zombies may not use shields to deflect foam darts, marshmallows or socks.</p>
          <p><strong>Athletes:</strong> Athletes are safe during official practices, but not on the way to or from practice.</p>
          <p><strong>Required Academic Events:</strong> Similarly, students at required academic events are safe for the duration of the event (even if this event is in a free-play zone), but they are not safe on the way to or from the event.</p>
          <h2>DBag Clause</h2>
          <p><strong>Don&rsquo;t be a douchebag.</strong> Everyone plays Humans vs. Zombies to have fun, and the rules of HvZ only exist because we agree they do. That&rsquo;s why the most important rule of Humans vs. Zombies is to treat your fellow players with respect, and gracefully accept when you have been tagged or stunned.</p>
