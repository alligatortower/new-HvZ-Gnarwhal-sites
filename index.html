            <p>Since beginning at Goucher college in 2005, Humans vs. Zombies has developed an international fan base and received prominent press coverage from the <i>New York Times</i>, the <i>Washington Post</i>, <i>NPR</i>, the <i>Associated Press</i>, and The Colbert Report, who named us the number one threat to America. HvZ is played worldwide from Australia to Zimbabwe; there are games on every continent except Antarctica, and we're working on that.</p>

          <h1>The Rules</h1>
          <p class="rules-intro">These are the official &rdquo;Goucher-Style&rdquo; Humans vs. Zombies rules as invented by Brad Sappington and Chris Weed in 2005, with a few changes since to make the game more balanced and safe.</p>
	        <p class='rules-intro'>We encourage you to adapt the rules to fit your game &dash; account for what will keep your players safe and your game exciting. You can see dozens of alternate rule sets on the <a href="http://wiki.humansvszombies.org/" target="_blank">wiki</a> or talk to players about <a href="http://forums.humansvszombies.org/" target="_blank">what works best in their games</a>.</p>
	        <h2>Overview</h2>
	        <p>Humans vs. Zombies is a game of tag. All players begin as humans, and one is randomly chosen to be the &ldquo;Original Zombie.&rdquo; The Original Zombie tags human players and turns them into zombies. Zombies must tag and eat a human every 48 hours or they starve to death and are out of the game.</p>
          <h2>Objective</h2>
          <p>The Zombies win when all human players have been tagged and turned into zombies.</p>
	        <p>The Humans win by surviving long enough for all of the zombies to starve.</p>
          <h2>Equipment</h2>
          <p>This gear is required for all players:</p>
	        <ul>
            <li>Bandana</li>
            <li>Foam Dart Blaster, Marshmallow Launcher, and/or socks</li>
            <li>One 3x5 index card</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Human Rules</h2>
	        <p><strong>Wearing a Bandanna:</strong> Humans must wear a headband around an arm or leg to identify them as players of the game. (This headband will come in handy when you become a zombie!)</p>
	        <p><strong>Stunning a Zombie:</strong> Humans may stun a Zombie for 15 minutes by blasting them with a blaster or throwing a sock at them.</p>
	        <p><strong>When Tagged By a Zombie:</strong> When tagged by a Zombie, a Human is required to distribute their ID card. One hour after being tagged, tie your bandanna around your head &ndash; you are now a member of the Zombie team! Go tag some Humans.</p>
	        <p><strong>I.D. Number:</strong> Humans must keep an index card with their unique identification number on them at all times.</p>
          <p><strong>Staying On Campus:</strong> Humans must sleep on campus. If you need to leave campus for longer than 24 hours, contact the game moderators and remove yourself from the game.</p>
          <h2>Zombie Rules</h2>
	        <p><strong>Feeding:</strong> Zombies must feed every 48 hours. A zombie feeds by reporting their tag on the website.</p>
	        <p><strong>Tagging</strong>: A tag is a firm touch to any part of a Human. After tagging a Human the Zombie must collect their ID card and report the tag.</p>
	        <p><strong>Getting Shot:</strong> When hit with a dart, a marshmallow, or a sock, a Zombie is stunned for 15 minutes. A stunned zombie may not interact with the game in any way. This includes shielding other zombies from bullets or continuing to run toward a human. If shot while stunned, the zombie&rsquo;s stun timer is reset back to 15 minutes.</p>
	        <p><strong>Wearing A Headband:</strong> Zombies must wear a bandanna around their heads at all times. The Original Zombie does not need to wear a headband.</p>

          <h2>How do I start a game of Humans vs. Zombies</h2>
          <p>Anyone can start a game of Humans vs. Zombies; you don't need our permission. The only rule is that you can't charge people to play or require them to buy any bullshit. We make a free online service called <a href="http://hvzsource.com">HvZ SOURCE</a> that makes it easy for anyone to start a game of Humans vs. Zombies. We wrote this guide (the <a href="http://wiki.humansvszombies.org/index.php/The_HvZ_Game_Guide" target="_blank">Dungeon Master's Guide</a>) to help moderators start a new game.</p>
          <h2>How do I find games of Humans vs. Zombies to play in?</h2>
          <p>Most games of Humans vs. Zombies are hosted on college campuses and limited to students. You can search <a href="http://hvzsource.com" target="_blank">HvZ SOURCE</a> for a game near you.</p>
          <h2>Is Humans vs. Zombies safe to play?</h2>
          <p>Humans vs. Zombies is played safely every day all around the world. It's a physical activity like tag or soccer, so we recommend asking players to sign a safety waiver before the game. If you play with dart blasters, we also strongly urge organizers to clear that with their school and/or local law enforcement; you don't want to scare or surprise anyone. Over nine years and thousands of games, Humans vs. Zombies has proven to be safe and delightful for players and spectators.</p>
