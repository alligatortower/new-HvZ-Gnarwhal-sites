            <p>Since beginning at Goucher college in 2005, Humans vs. Zombies has developed an international fan base and received prominent press coverage from the <i>New York Times</i>, the <i>Washington Post</i>, <i>NPR</i>, the <i>Associated Press</i>, and The Colbert Report, who named us the number one threat to America. HvZ is played worldwide from Australia to Zimbabwe; there are games on every continent except Antarctica, and we're working on that.</p>
            <p>Humans vs. Zombies is always free to play, and made available under a Creative Commons license.</p>

          <blockquote>"It's free, you know. And it's freeing, too. Phenomenally freeing. You don't have to be a kid to play. You don't have to be in elementary school or high school or college even. Call it team building. Call it community building. Play in the park, in the playground, in a corporate plaza, a senior center, in an office building, in hospital corridors, in the neighborhood. It transforms the world. It's awesome fun."</blockquote>

          <h2>Who are you guys?</h2>
          <p>We are the original co-creators of Humans vs. Zombies: <a href="#">Chris Weed</a>, <a href="#">Brad Sappington</a>,  <a href="#">Joe Sklover</a>,  <a href="#">Justin Quick</a>,  <a href="#">Trevor Moorman</a>,  <a href="#">Ben Beecher</a>, and <a href="#">Max Temkin</a>. Now we have a game company called <a href="#">Gnarwhal Studios</a> dedicated to maintaining Humans vs. Zombies as a free project and making new multiplayer experiences.</p>
          <h2>How do I start a game of Humans vs. Zombies</h2>
          <p>Anyone can start a game of Humans vs. Zombies; you don't need our permission. The only rule is that you can't charge people to play or require them to buy any bullshit. We make a free online service called <a href="http://hvzsource.com">HvZ SOURCE</a> that makes it easy for anyone to start a game of Humans vs. Zombies. We wrote this guide (the <a href="#">Dungeon Master's Guide</a>) to help moderators start a new game.</p>
          <h2>How do I find games of Humans vs. Zombies to play in?</h2>
          <p>Most games of Humans vs. Zombies are hosted on college campuses and limited to students. You can search <a href="http://hvzsource.com">HvZ Source</a> for a game near you.</p>
          <h2>Is Humans vs. Zombies safe to play?</h2>
          <p>Humans vs. Zombies is played safely every day all around the world. It's a physical activity like tag or soccer, so we recommend asking players to sign a safety waiver before the game. If you play with NERF blasters, we also strongly urge organizers to clear that with their school and/or local law enforcement; you don't want to scare or surprise anyone. Over nine years and thousands of games, Humans vs. Zombies has proven to be safe and delightful for players and spectators.</p>
