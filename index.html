            <p>Since beginning at Goucher college in 2005, Humans vs. Zombies has developed an international fan base and received prominent press coverage from the <i>New York Times</i>, the <i>Washington Post</i>, <i>NPR</i>, the <i>Associated Press</i>, and The Colbert Report, who named us the number one threat to America. HvZ is played worldwide from Australia to Zimbabwe; there are games on every continent except Antarctica, and we're working on that.</p>

          <h1>The Rules</h1>
          <p class="rules-intro">These are the official &rdquo;Goucher-Style&rdquo; Humans vs. Zombies rules as invented by Brad Sappington and Chris Weed in 2005, with a few changes since to make the game more balanced and safe.</p>
	        <p class='rules-intro'>We encourage you to adapt the rules to fit your game &dash; account for what will keep your players safe and your game exciting. You can see dozens of alternate rule sets on the <a href="http://wiki.humansvszombies.org/" target="_blank">wiki</a> or talk to players about <a href="http://forums.humansvszombies.org/" target="_blank">what works best in their games</a>.</p>
	        <h2>Overview</h2>
	        <p>Humans vs. Zombies is a game of tag. All players begin as humans, and one is randomly chosen to be the &ldquo;Original Zombie.&rdquo; The Original Zombie tags human players and turns them into zombies. Zombies must tag and eat a human every 48 hours or they starve to death and are out of the game.</p>
          <h2>Objective</h2>
          <p>The Zombies win when all human players have been tagged and turned into zombies.</p>
	        <p>The Humans win by surviving long enough for all of the zombies to starve.</p>

          <p>Other areas on campus are merely "safe zones", where gameplay continues but humans can't be tagged (unless a zombie has both of their feet outside the safe zone). These areas include: <strong>Dorm rooms</strong> and <strong>Dining Halls</strong></p>
          <h2>Safety Rules</h2>
          <p>Rules created for the safety of all players are strictly enforced. Violation of safety rules will result in a ban from the game.</p>

              <center><h2>Human Rules</h2></center>
              <p><strong>Wearing a Bandanna:</strong> Humans must wear a headband around an arm or leg to identify them as players of the game. (This headband will come in handy when you become a zombie!)</p>
              <p><strong>Stunning a Zombie:</strong> Humans may stun a Zombie for 15 minutes by blasting them with a blaster or throwing a sock at them.</p>
              <p><strong>When Tagged By a Zombie:</strong> When tagged by a Zombie, a Human is required to distribute their ID card. One hour after being tagged, tie your bandanna around your head &ndash; you are now a member of the Zombie team! Go tag some Humans.</p>
              <p><strong>I.D. Number:</strong> Humans must keep an index card with their unique identification number on them at all times.</p>
              <p><strong>Staying On Campus:</strong> Humans must sleep on campus. If you need to leave campus for longer than 24 hours, contact the game moderators and remove yourself from the game.</p>
            </div>
            <div class='team-column'>
              <center><h2>Zombie Rules</h2></center>
              <p><strong>Feeding:</strong> Zombies must feed every 48 hours. A zombie feeds by reporting their tag on the website.</p>
              <p><strong>Tagging</strong>: A tag is a firm touch to any part of a Human. After tagging a Human the Zombie must collect their ID card and report the tag.</p>
              <p><strong>Getting Shot:</strong> When hit with a dart, a marshmallow, or a sock, a Zombie is stunned for 15 minutes. A stunned zombie may not interact with the game in any way. This includes shielding other zombies from bullets or continuing to run toward a human. If shot while stunned, the zombie&rsquo;s stun timer is reset back to 15 minutes.</p>
              <p><strong>Wearing A Headband:</strong> Zombies must wear a bandanna around their heads at all times. The Original Zombie does not need to wear a headband.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <h2>Other Rules</h2>
          <p>Blasting Non-Players: Blasting non-players is a bannable offense.</p>
          <p>Non-Player Interference: People who are not registered participants may not directly interact with the game. This includes bringing food to humans or spying for either team.</p>
          <p>Safe Zones: A zombie must have both feet outside of a safe zone to tag a human. Humans can stun zombies from inside of a safe-zone.</p>
          <p>No Shields: Zombies may not use shields to deflect foam darts, marshmallows or socks.</p>
          <p>Athletes: Athletes are safe during official practices, but not on the way to or from practice.</p>
          <p>Required Academic Events: Similarly, students at required academic events are safe for the duration of the event (even if this event is in a free-play zone), but they are not safe on the way to or from the event.</p>
          <div class='dbag-row'>
            <h2>DBag Clause</h2>
            <p>Don&rsquo;t be a douchebag. Everyone plays Humans vs. Zombies to have fun, and the rules of HvZ only exist because we agree they do. That&rsquo;s why the most important rule of Humans vs. Zombies is to treat your fellow players with respect, and gracefully accept when you have been tagged or stunned.</p>

          <p>We are the original co-creators of Humans vs. Zombies: <a href="http://twitter.com/cweedtweets" target="_blank">Chris Weed</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/HammerOfPorp" target="_blank">Brad Sappington</a>,  <a href="https://twitter.com/sklover" target="_blank">Joe Sklover</a>,  <a href="https://twitter.com/justquick" target="_blank">Justin Quick</a>,  <a href="https://twitter.com/MrPTrevor" target="_blank">Trevor Moorman</a>,  <a href="http://twitter.com/kanja" target="_blank">Ben Beecher</a>, and <a href="http://twitter.com/maxtemkin" target="_blank">Max Temkin</a>. We have a game company called <a href="http://GnarwhalStudios.com" target="_blank">Gnarwhal Studios</a> dedicated to maintaining Humans vs. Zombies as a free project and making new multiplayer experiences.</p>
          <h2>How do I start a game of Humans vs. Zombies</h2>
          <p>Anyone can start a game of Humans vs. Zombies; you don't need our permission. The only rule is that you can't charge people to play or require them to buy any bullshit. We make a free online service called <a href="http://hvzsource.com">HvZ SOURCE</a> that makes it easy for anyone to start a game of Humans vs. Zombies. We wrote this guide (the <a href="http://wiki.humansvszombies.org/index.php/The_HvZ_Game_Guide" target="_blank">Dungeon Master's Guide</a>) to help moderators start a new game.</p>
          <h2>How do I find games of Humans vs. Zombies to play in?</h2>
          <p>Most games of Humans vs. Zombies are hosted on college campuses and limited to students. You can search <a href="http://hvzsource.com" target="_blank">HvZ SOURCE</a> for a game near you.</p>
          <h2>Is Humans vs. Zombies safe to play?</h2>
          <p>Humans vs. Zombies is played safely every day all around the world. It's a physical activity like tag or soccer, so we recommend asking players to sign a safety waiver before the game. If you play with dart blasters, we also strongly urge organizers to clear that with their school and/or local law enforcement; you don't want to scare or surprise anyone. Over nine years and thousands of games, Humans vs. Zombies has proven to be safe and delightful for players and spectators.</p>
